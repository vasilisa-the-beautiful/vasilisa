Let’s have conversations in the dark&lt;br /&gt;
World asleep and I’m awake with you&lt;br /&gt;
With you&lt;br /&gt;
Watch&lt;br /&gt;
Movies that we’ve both already seen&lt;br /&gt;
I ain’t even looking at the screen, it’s true&lt;br /&gt;
I got my eyes on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you say that you’re not worthy&lt;br /&gt;
You get hung up on your flaws&lt;br /&gt;
But in my eyes, you are perfect&lt;br /&gt;
As you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t ever try to change you, change you&lt;br /&gt;
I will always want the same you, same you&lt;br /&gt;
Swear on everything I pray to&lt;br /&gt;
That I won’t break your heart&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll be there when you get lonely, lonely&lt;br /&gt;
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me&lt;br /&gt;
And your love is all you owe me&lt;br /&gt;
And I won’t break your heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On&lt;br /&gt;
Sunday mornings we sleep in till noon&lt;br /&gt;
Well, I can sleep forever next to you&lt;br /&gt;
Next to you&lt;br /&gt;
And we&lt;br /&gt;
We got places we both gotta be&lt;br /&gt;
But there ain’t nothing I would rather do&lt;br /&gt;
Than blow off all my plans for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you say that you’re not worthy&lt;br /&gt;
And get hung up on your flaws&lt;br /&gt;
But, in my eyes, you are perfect&lt;br /&gt;
As you are&lt;br /&gt;
As you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t ever try to change you, change you&lt;br /&gt;
I will always want the same you, same you&lt;br /&gt;
Swear on everything I pray to&lt;br /&gt;
That I won’t break your heart&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll be there when you get lonely, lonely&lt;br /&gt;
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me&lt;br /&gt;
And your love is all you owe me&lt;br /&gt;
And I won’t break your heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When no one seems to notice&lt;br /&gt;
And your days, they seem so hard&lt;br /&gt;
My darling, you should know this&lt;br /&gt;
My love is everywhere you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t ever try to change you, change you&lt;br /&gt;
I will always want the same you, same you&lt;br /&gt;
