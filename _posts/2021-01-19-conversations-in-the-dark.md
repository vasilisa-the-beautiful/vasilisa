Talk\
Let's have conversations in the dark\
World asleep and I'm awake with you\
With you\
Watch\
Movies that we've both already seen\
I ain't even looking at the screen, it's true\
I got my eyes on you

And you say that you're not worthy\
You get hung up on your flaws\
But in my eyes, you are perfect\
As you are

I won't ever try to change you, change you\
I will always want the same you, same you\
Swear on everything I pray to\
That I won't break your heart\
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely\
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me\
And your love is all you owe me\
And I won't break your heart

On\
Sunday mornings we sleep in till noon\
Well, I can sleep forever next to you\
Next to you\
And we\
We got places we both gotta be\
But there ain't nothing I would rather do\
Than blow off all my plans for you

And you say that you're not worthy\
And get hung up on your flaws\
But, in my eyes, you are perfect\
As you are\
As you are

I won't ever try to change you, change you\
I will always want the same you, same you\
Swear on everything I pray to\
That I won't break your heart\
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely\
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me\
And your love is all you owe me\
And I won't break your heart

When no one seems to notice\
And your days, they seem so hard\
My darling, you should know this\
My love is everywhere you are

I won't ever try to change you, change you\
I will always want the same you, same you\
Swear on everything I pray to\
That I won't break your heart\
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely\
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me\
And your love is all you owe me\
And I won't break your heart

I won't break your heart
