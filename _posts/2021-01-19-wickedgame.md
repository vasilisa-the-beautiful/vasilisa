<p><em>It's strange what desire will make foolish people do*<br>
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you<br>
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you<br>
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
With you<br>
With you<br>
(This world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way<br>
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you<br>
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way<br>
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you<br>
And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
With you<br>
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you<br>
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do<br>
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you<br>
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you<br>
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
With you (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you<br>
(This world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
No, I (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
(This world is only gonna break your heart)<br>
Nobody loves no one<br>
